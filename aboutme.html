        <div ></div><h1 style="background-color: palegoldenrod;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font: size 12pt;">In the future, I want to specialize in engineering, specifically technology. I always had an interest in coding, especially block based coding. My plans for achieving this goal are that I want to study different methods and variations in coding and researching what can I do with the code. Some others plans are that I can ask my parents or family members who work in that field on how to do the specific coding tasks that will help me get closer to achieving my goal. Lastly, this is my goal/career choice because it is like family tradition to become either a doctor or an engineer. I didn't like the procedures of what a doctor does, so I chose to become an engineer. Like I said previously, I really like coding, so this is one of the top choices I want to become.

        <div align="left"><p style="font-family:verdana"></p>Some characteristics I have are that I am a very good problem solver and I am very persistant in when I have a problem. I always try to find a solution that can help me achieve the answer to my proble. Additionally, I am very outgoing with my peers, so this allows me to contribute with others well and I also understand ideas and ways that other people feel. Some major accomplishments I have achieved are that I have obtained more than 3.8 GPA this quarter, and I am very proud of this. Based on this, I have observed that I am very patient and I alwas want to try my best whenever I am posed a problem.  
        <p>To sum up, I believe that I have the skills to go through the process and become an comptur science engineer. I also believe that I am very patient which is another important trait to have in order to persist in my career to become a computer engineer. Computer science is a very fun for people like me who like to go through challenges and who want to persue in a career where they want to connect with code and other tech related things.</p>
